## Notes

Originally, I built my project using a different API, but I reached the rate limit, 
which is why I needed to switch to the current API I am using. I am still struggling
with the rate limit of my current API, and I believe that it is the reason
why my 3rd statistic is not visible as shown in my GIF.
